The global economy is intricately tied to the impacts of global warming, as rising temperatures and climate change continue to disrupt industries and resources worldwide. Agriculture, a cornerstone of many economies, is under threat from extreme weather patterns, droughts, and unpredictable growing seasons. Coastal cities, which serve as economic hubs, face escalating costs due to flooding and rising sea levels. Moreover, the increasing frequency of natural disasters imposes a heavy financial burden on governments and businesses, diverting resources from development to recovery. Energy sectors are also transforming, with a growing shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources, driven by the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions. While this transition creates opportunities in green technology, it also challenges traditional economic models, compelling nations to adapt their policies and investments. Global warming thus poses a dual challenge: mitigating its effects while reshaping the economic landscape for a sustainable future.
